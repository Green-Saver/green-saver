              The location which is quite far from the center of Batam city (60km) makes this location a negative value. But when you are at the location, it will all be worth it. For a fee of Â± 400 thousand, you can get sea transportation,
              snorkeling equipment, lunch, photo services, etc. Most like having lunch on the clean beach then continuing snorkeling to the coral reefs and fish which are nice and shallow, about 2 meters from the sea surface.
